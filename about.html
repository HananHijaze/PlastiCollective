    <h1>Who Are We</h1>
    <p> PlastiCollective is a company that collects plastic waste from customers' homes and transfers it to plastic recycling companies, at the same time the company offers its customers lots of coupons and benefits.
The company was established with the goal of protecting the environment and awarding our customer's unique discounts and coupons at the same time.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">OUR STORY</h1>
    <p>The idea started when we noticed the difficulties that anyone can face when the subject is recycling plastic, such as:</p>
<ul class="list1">
<br><br>
<li class="list2" data-emoji="♻️">Collecting the plastic.</li>
<br><br>
<li class="list2" data-emoji="♻️">Delivering plastic waste to recycling companies.</li>
<br><br>
<li class="list2" data-emoji="♻️">Finding recycling companies that are close to you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Although there are too many containers on the streets that collect plastic it has been neglected for a very long time and people don't use it anymore.
So we came up with our idea PlastiCollective which makes the process of recycling plastic easier</p>
